## What guide did i follow for this
https://realpython.com/django-flashcards-app/

## What it is about
Flashcards are a great tool when you want to memorize a new topic or learn a new language. You write a question on the front of the card and the answer on the back of the card. Then you can test your memory by going through the flashcards. The more often you show a card to yourself, the better your chances of memorizing its content. With Django, you can build your own flashcards app.

## What i learned during this tutorial
- Set up a Django project
- Work with a SQLite database and the Django shell
- Create models and class-based views
- Structure and nest templates
- Create custom template tags
